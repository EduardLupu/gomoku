# Gomoku

Created a [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) game using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/).
The player has the option to choose between a graphical user interface or a console based interface and also between a competitive AI or a AI based on randomness.
